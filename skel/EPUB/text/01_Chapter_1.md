## Capter 1 â€“ How to Format Your Book

Since the `h1` ("#" in markdown) tag is generally used for the Main Title of the book, begin each chapter using the `h2` ("##") tag.

Images in the `media` directory must be specified from the root directory path. For example:

![My Cover](./src/media/cover.png)

### Markdown Syntax
